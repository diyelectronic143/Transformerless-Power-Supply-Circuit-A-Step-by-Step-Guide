# Transformerless-Power-Supply-Circuit-A-Step-by-Step-Guide

## Story
In today's blog, we embark on a journey to demystify the creation of a universal transformerless power supply circuit that converts 220V AC to DC, a fundamental component for countless electronic projects. Before delving into the intricacies of the circuit, let's emphasize the paramount importance of safety when working with 220V AC. Always prioritize safety measures to avoid potential hazards.

# Essential Components:
To Embark on this Transformative DIY project, gather the following components:

- 2.2uF 400V Capacitor
- 470uF 100V Capacitor
- 470k 1W Resistor
- 100R 1W Resistor
- 220R 1W Resistor
- 1K Resistor
- 1N4007 Diode (x4)
- Zener Diode (voltage depends on your requirements)

These components are readily available at your local market or even within old emergency rechargeable lights or torches.

# Building the Circuit:

If you possess the technical know-how, proceed with assembling the circuit. However, if you lack the expertise, I strongly advise against attempting this, as it involves potential electrical hazards.For those not inclined towards the intricacies of a transformerless circuit, an alternative is a transformer power supply, which is simpler to construct. A video tutorial on YouTube further simplifies the process for the uninitiated.

# Schematic Diagram:
The [schematic diagram](https://www.diyelectronic.in/2024/01/Transformerless%20Power%20Supply%20Circuit.html) reveals the heart of the circuit. The 2.2uF 400V capacitor is connected in series, accompanied by a parallel connection of a 470k 1W resistor. Pay close attention to the capacitor's polarity during the assembly process. The 470uF 100V electrolytic capacitor requires precise connection according to the schematic diagram.

## Diode Dynamics:
The 1N4007 diodes play a pivotal role in the circuit, forming a bridge rectifier configuration that converts AC to DC. To enhance the DC output, a capacitor is connected to the bridge rectifier. The versatility of the Zener diode becomes apparent here, allowing customization of the output voltage. This adaptability solidifies the circuit's claim as a universal power supply.

## Additional Features:
Incorporating an LED as an indicator adds a visual element to the circuit, signaling its operational status. However, exercise caution and refrain from touching the DC output, as safety features are not integrated, and contact may result in a mild electric shock.
